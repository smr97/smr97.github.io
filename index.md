## Tell me something about yourself
I am a 22 year old computer scientist working with IBM Research. 
I went to college at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science [(BITS)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in a small village called Pilani, in India. 

## Keep going
My work is primarily aimed at making AI faster. As a fallback, I make Deep Neural Networks memory efficient. 


Previously, I have done some research in high performance computing at [ETH Zurich](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/) and [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/datamove).

## Don't stop!
I enjoy various physical pursuits. While powerlifting gives me my daily adrenaline fix, I do some hiking and skiing when I take a vacation.

My childhood dream was to be a pilot. Occasionally, I fire up my [simulator](https://pmdg.com/pmdg-737ngx-base-package-for-fsx/) and fly around in my favourite, the Boeing 737-800.

This page has several blog posts, currently most of them are 'convoluted ramblings' as a [friend](ankitsultana.com) puts it. I would, however, also be adding several posts about the domains I work in, why are they exciting, and what particularly am I working on in that regard. 

That's it, stalker! Head over to Blogs or check out my Resume or better yet, a full curriculum vitae.
