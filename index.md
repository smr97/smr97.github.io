I am a PhD student at the University of Utah, advised by Prof. Saday Sadayappan.
My research interests lies broadly in High Performance Computing (HPC).
In the past, I have worked with IBM Research in New Delhi, towards making AI faster.
As a student, I did some research in languages and middleware for HPC at [ETH Zurich](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/) and [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/datamove).
I went to college at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science [(BITS)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in a small village called Pilani, in India.
While powerlifting gives me my daily adrenaline fix, I like to hike and ski when on a vacation.
