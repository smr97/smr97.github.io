I am a Research SDE working with IBM Research. 
I went to college at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science [(BITS)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in a small village called Pilani, in India. 
These days, I work on making neural networks faster. More specifically, towards training of Dynamic Graph Neural Networks on hundreds of GPUs. Prior to joining IBM, I did some research in high performance computing at [ETH Zurich](https://spcl.inf.ethz.ch/) and [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/datamove).
While powerlifting gives me my daily adrenaline fix, I like to hike and ski when on a vacation.
